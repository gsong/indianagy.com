## GitHub Project Management

When asked to work with GitHub projects, use the `github-project-manager` agent via the Task tool. This agent is specialized for managing GitHub project #2 ("India's website") including:

- Adding issues to the project
- Updating issue status (Ready, Blocked, In progress, Done)
- Managing project items and operations
- Working with pull requests in the project context

Example usage:

```
Task tool with subagent_type: "github-project-manager"
```
